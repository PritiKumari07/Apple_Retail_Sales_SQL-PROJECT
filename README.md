## Objectives


1. Find the number of stores in each country.

```sql
SELECT 
	country,
	COUNT(store_id) as total_stores
FROM stores
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

```


2. Calculate the total number of units sold by each store.

```sql
SELECT 
	s.store_id,
	st.store_name,
	SUM(s.quantity) as total_unit_sold
FROM sales as s
JOIN
stores as st
ON st.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC

```

3. Identify how many sales occurred in December 2023.

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(sale_id) as total_sale 
FROM sales
WHERE TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'MM-YYYY') = '12-2023'
```


4. Determine how many stores have never had a warranty claim filed.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stores
WHERE store_id NOT IN (
						SELECT 
							DISTINCT store_id
						FROM sales as s
						RIGHT JOIN warranty as w
						ON s.sale_id = w.sale_id
						);
```



5. Calculate the percentage of warranty claims marked as "Warranty Void".

```sql
SELECT 
	ROUND
		(COUNT(claim_id)/
						(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warranty)::numeric 
		* 100, 
	2)as warranty_void_percentage
FROM warranty
WHERE repair_status = 'Warranty Void'
```


6. Identify which store had the highest total units sold in the last year.

```sql
SELECT 
	s.store_id,
	st.store_name,
	SUM(s.quantity)
FROM sales as s
JOIN stores as st
ON s.store_id = st.store_id
WHERE sale_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year')
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1
```


7. Count the number of unique products sold in the last year.

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT product_id)
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year')
```



8. Find the average price of products in each category.

```sql
SELECT 
	p.category_id,
	c.category_name,
	AVG(p.price) as avg_price

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) as warranty_claim
FROM warranty
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM claim_date) = 2020
```



10. For each store, identify the best-selling day based on highest quantity sold.
-- store_id, day_name, sum(qty)
--  window dense rank 


```sql
SELECT  * 
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		store_id,
		TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day') as day_name,
		SUM(quantity) as total_unit_sold,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY store_id ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC) as rank
	FROM sales
	GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
```


11. Identify the least selling product in each country for each year based on total units sold.

```sql

GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
* 
FROM product_rank
WHERE rank = 1
```


12. Calculate how many warranty claims were filed within 180 days of a product sale.

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*)
FROM warranty as w
LEFT JOIN 
sales as s
ON s.sale_id = w.sale_id
WHERE 
	w.claim_date - sale_date <= 180
```



13. Determine how many warranty claims were filed for products launched in the last two years.
-- each prod 
--  no claim
--  no sale
-- each must be launcnhed in last 2 year

```sql
SELECT 
	p.product_name,
	COUNT(w.claim_id) as no_claim,

```



16. Determine the percentage chance of receiving warranty claims after each purchase for each country.

```sql
SELECT 
	country,
	total_unit_sold,
	total_claim,

	,3) as growth_ratio
FROM growth_ratio
WHERE 
	last_year_sale IS NOT NULL
	AND 
	YEAR <> EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)

```

18. Calculate the correlation between product price and warranty claims for products sold in the last five years, segmented by price range.

```sql
SELECT 
	
	CASE
		WHEN p.price < 500 THEN 'Less Expenses Product'
		WHEN p.price BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Mid Range Product'

JOIN  total_repaired tr ON pr.store_id = tr.store_id
JOIN stores as st ON tr.store_id = st.store_id
```


20. Write a query to calculate the monthly running total of sales for each store over the past four years and compare trends during this period.

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS

		WHEN s.sale_date BETWEEN  p.launch_date + INTERVAL '12 month'  AND p.launch_date + INTERVAL '18 month' THEN '6-12'
		ELSE '18+'
	END as plc,
	SUM(s.quantity) as total_qty_sale
	
FROM sales as s
JOIN products as p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC
